*   What are the differences between Unit Testing, Functional Testing and Integration Testing.

>>  (1) Unit Testing:

        - Testing individual units/pieces of code in isolation, typically one method or function at a time.

        Example:

            - Suppose a class has a saveUser() method.

            - In Unit Testing, you check if that method functions properly.

    (2) Functional Testing:

        - Testing the functionality of a system from the user's point of view, ensuring that the functionality behaves 
          according to the requirements.

        Example:

            - Suppose there's a login functionality which performs multiple operation behind.

            - In Functional Testing, you would check if login functionality works properly or not.
    
    (3) Integration Testing:

        - Testing multiple components, modules, or systems together after they are integrated, to 
          ensure they interact and function correctly as a group.
        
        Example:

            - Suppose there's a module A for User Registration and module B for Email Notification Service.

            - In Integration Testing, you check after a user registers, an email is actually sent.

*   What is Test-Driven Development (TDD) ?

>>  TDD is a software development approach where developers write test cases first for a new feature or functionality 
    before writing the actual code. 
    
    The development process follows a short, repetitive TDD cycle also called "Red-Green-Refactor": 
    
        (1) Red: 
        
            - Write a test for the new functionality; it fails (since the feature isn't built yet).
        
        (2) Green: 
        
            - Write just enough code to make the test pass.
        
        (3) Refactor: 
        
            - Improve the code's structure and design without changing its behavior, while ensuring the test still passes.

    Key Benefits:

        - Ensures better code quality and design.

        - Helps in early bug detection.

        - Encourages smaller, modular, and loosely-coupled code units.

    Example:

        - You want to build an add(int a, int b) method.

        (1) First, write a test:

            ```
                @Test
                void testAddition() {
                    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
                    assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));
                }
            ```

        (2) Run the test: 
        
            - It will fail as method not implemented yet.

        (3) Implement the minimal working code:

            ```
                int add(int a, int b) {
                    return a + b;
                }
            ```

        (4) Test passes.

        (5) Refactor if needed (e.g., improve naming, handle edge cases).

*   What is the difference between manual testing and unit testing ?

>>  Manual Testing is the process of testing software by human testers without using any automated tools or scripts where 
    testers execute test cases manually to find defects 
    
    Unit Testing involves testing individual units or components of code (like methods or functions) automatically, 
    typically using a unit testing framework (e.g., JUnit for Java).

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is JUnit ? Why do we use it ?

>>  JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java, primarily used to perform unit testing of individual components 
    (like classes and methods) to ensure code correctness and catch bugs early during development.

    It provides annotations, assertions, and tools to write, execute, and organize test cases efficiently. 

    Why use it:

        - Automates repetitive testing tasks.

        - Supports Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
            import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

            class CalculatorTest {

                @Test
                void testAddition() {

                    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
                    assertEquals(5, calc.add(2, 3));
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What are the benefits of using unit testing frameworks like JUnit ?

>>  (1) Automation:
        
        - Quickly run thousands of test cases automatically without manual intervention.

    (2) Supports Test-Driven Development (TDD):

        - Encourages writing tests first and building code around them, leading to better-designed software.

    (3) Integration with Build Tools:
        
        - Easily integrates with tools like Maven, Jenkins etc for continuous testing during builds and deployments.

    (4) Detailed Reporting:
        
        - Provides clear reports on which tests passed or failed, helping in faster debugging.

*   Explain the lifecycle of a JUnit test case.

>>  The lifecycle of a JUnit test case refers to the sequence of events that occur from the start to the end of a test 
    method’s execution. 
    
    It includes initializing the test environment, running the test, and cleaning up after the test finishes. 
    
    Lifecycle Phases (in JUnit 5):
        
        (1) Before Test Execution:

            (a) @BeforeAll: 
            
                - Runs once before all test methods in the class. Typically used for expensive setup tasks 
                  (e.g., database connections).

            (b) @BeforeEach: 
            
                - Runs before each test method. Used to set up the test environment (e.g., initializing variables).

        (2) Test Method Execution:

            - The test method itself is executed, and assertions are made to validate the expected behavior.

        (3) After Test Execution:

            (a) @AfterEach: 
            
                - Runs after each test method. Used for cleanup tasks (e.g., resetting values, closing files).

            (b) @AfterAll: 
            
                - Runs once after all test methods in the class. Typically used for global cleanup tasks 
                  (e.g., closing database connections).

        (4) Test Result:

            - The test either passes (assertions are true) or fails (assertions are false).

    Example:

        ```
            class MyTest {

                @BeforeAll
                static void setupAll() {
                    System.out.println("Running before all tests");
                }

                @BeforeEach
                void setup() {
                    System.out.println("Running before each test");
                }

                @Test
                void testMethod1() {
                    System.out.println("Executing testMethod1");
                    Assertions.assertTrue(true);
                }

                @Test
                void testMethod2() {
                    System.out.println("Executing testMethod2");
                    Assertions.assertTrue(true);
                }

                @AfterEach
                void cleanup() {
                    System.out.println("Running after each test");
                }

                @AfterAll
                static void cleanupAll() {
                    System.out.println("Running after all tests");
                }
            }
        ```
        
        Output:

            ```
                Running before all tests
                Running before each test
                Executing testMethod1
                Running after each test
                Running before each test
                Executing testMethod2
                Running after each test
                Running after all tests
            ```

*   How do you write a basic Test Case in JUnit ?

>>  Steps to write a basic JUnit Test Case:
        
        (1) Create a test class:
            
            - Annotate the class with @Test to indicate it contains test methods.

        (2) Write a test method:
            
            - Each test case should be a method annotated with @Test. Inside the method, you call the code to be 
              tested and use assertions to verify the result.

        (3) Use assertions:
            
            - Assertions compare the expected output with the actual output (e.g., assertEquals, assertTrue, etc.).

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
            import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

            class CalculatorTest {

                @Test
                void testAddition() {
                    Calculator calc = new Calculator();
                    int result = calc.add(2, 3);  // Method being tested
                    assertEquals(5, result);      // Assertion to verify result
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What are various annotations available in JUnit ?

>>  Complete list of annotations in JUnit 5:
        
        (1) @Test
        (2) @BeforeEach
        (3) @AfterEach
        (4) @BeforeAll

        (8) @Rule
        (9) @ClassRule
        (10) @Category
        (11) @Parameterized

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What does @Test annotation do in JUnit ?

>>  The @Test annotation in JUnit is used to mark a method as a test case.

    When a method is annotated with @Test, the JUnit framework automatically recognizes and executes it during the test 
    run without needing to call the method manually.

    In JUnit 5, @Test comes from the org.junit.jupiter.api package and does not support attributes like expected and 
    timeout directly. Those concerns are handled using assertThrows and @Timeout separately.

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
            import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

            public class CalculatorTest {

                @Test
                void testAddition() {
                    int result = 2 + 3;
                    assertEquals(5, result, "Addition should be correct");
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the purpose of @BeforeEach ?

>>  The @BeforeEach annotation in JUnit is used to mark a method that should run before each test method in a test class
    typically used to perform setup tasks before every test runs.

    Key Features:
        
        - Runs before each test method, not once per class.

        - Helps avoid duplicate setup code across tests.

    Example:

        ```    
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

            public class CalculatorTest {

                private Calculator calculator;

                @BeforeEach
                void setUp() {
                    calculator = new Calculator(); // fresh instance before each test
                }

                @Test
                void testAddition() {
                    Assertions.assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3));
                }

                @Test
                void testSubtraction() {
                    Assertions.assertEquals(1, calculator.subtract(3, 2));
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the purpose of @AfterEach ?

>>  To perform cleanup operations after every test — such as releasing resources, resetting states, or clearing 
    temporary data.

    Key Features:
        
        - Runs after each test method finishes (regardless of whether the test passes or fails).

        - Ensures test isolation by cleaning up anything that may affect the next test.

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

            public class FileHandlerTest {

                private File tempFile;

                @BeforeEach
                void setUp() throws IOException {
                    tempFile = File.createTempFile("test", ".txt");
                }

                @Test
                void testFileWrite() {
                    // perform test using tempFile
                }

                @AfterEach
                void tearDown() {
                    if (tempFile != null && tempFile.exists()) {
                        tempFile.delete();  // clean up after test
                    }
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the purpose of @BeforeAll ?

>>  The @BeforeAll annotation in JUnit 5 is used to mark a method that runs once before all test methods in a test class 
    to perform one-time setup that is needed before any test runs e.g. database connection.

    Key Features:

        - Runs only once, before all test methods.

        - The method must be static unless the test class is annotated with @TestInstance(Lifecycle.PER_CLASS).

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

            @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
            public class DatabaseTest {

                @BeforeAll
                void initDatabase() {
                    System.out.println("Connecting to test database...");
                    // connect once before all tests
                }

                @Test
                void testQuery() {
                    // test something with database
                }

                @Test
                void testInsert() {
                    // another test using the same DB connection
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the purpose of @AfterAll ?

>>  The @AfterAll annotation in JUnit 5 marks a method that is run once after all the test methods in a test class 
    have been executed.

    It is used to perform one-time cleanup — like shutting down shared resources.

    Key Features:

        - Executes only once, after all tests in the class.

        - The method must be static unless the class uses @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS).
    
    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

            @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
            public class ServerTest {

                @BeforeAll
                void startServer() {
                    System.out.println("Starting server...");
                    // start server once
                }

                @Test
                void testRequestHandling() {
                    // test server response
                }

                @AfterAll
                void stopServer() {
                    System.out.println("Stopping server...");
                    // stop server after all tests
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the difference between @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, @BeforeAll and @AfterAll ?

>>  (1) @BeforeEach:

        - Runs before each test method.

        - Used for per-test setup (e.g., initializing mocks, setting up test data).

        - Does not need to be static.

    (2) @AfterEach:

        - Runs after each test method.

        - Used for per-test cleanup (e.g., clearing database, resetting mocks).

        - Does not need to be static.

    (3) @BeforeAll:

        - Runs once before all test methods in the class.

        - Used for global setup (e.g., starting a database, loading config).

        - Must be static, unless @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) is used.

    (4) @AfterAll:

        - Runs once after all test methods in the class.

        - Used for global cleanup (e.g., shutting down servers, closing DB).

        - Must be static, unless @TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS) is used.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the use of @Disabled in JUnit ?

>>  The @Disabled annotation in JUnit 5 is used to temporarily disable a test class or method, meaning JUnit will 
    skip execution of that test during the test run.

    Useful when:

        - A feature is under development.

        - A test depends on external systems currently unavailable.

    Example:

        - Disable a single test method.

            ```
                @Disabled
                @Test
                void testFeatureX() {
                    // This test will be skipped
                }
            ```

        - Disable an entire test class.

        - You can provide a reason string for documentation.

            ```
                @Disabled("Disabled until bug #1234 is fixed")
                class PaymentServiceTest {

                    @Test
                    void testPaymentProcessing() {
                        // Skipped
                    }
                }
            ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the use of @Order in JUnit ?

>>  The @Order annotation in JUnit 5 is used to specify the order in which test methods should be executed.

    Useful when test logic depends on the order (though generally discouraged — tests should be independent).

    The test class must be annotated with @TestMethodOrder.

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;

            @TestMethodOrder(MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation.class)
            class OrderedTest {

                @Test
                @Order(2)
                void secondTest() {
                    System.out.println("Second test");
                }

                @Test
                @Order(1)
                void firstTest() {
                    System.out.println("First test");
                }

                @Test
                @Order(3)
                void thirdTest() {
                    System.out.println("Third test");
                }
            }
        ```

*   What is the use of @ValueSource in JUnit ?

>>  The @ValueSource annotation is used in parameterized tests to supply a single array of literal values to the test method.

    It is used to run the same test logic multiple times, each time with a different value provided by @ValueSource.

    Supported Types:
        
        - short
        - byte 
        - int 
        - long 
        - float 
        - double 
        - char 
        - boolean 
        - String 
        - Class<?>

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
            import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ValueSource;
            import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

            class ValueSourceTest {

                @ParameterizedTest
                @ValueSource(ints = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8})
                void testWithIntValues(int number) {
                    assertTrue(number > 0);
                }

                @ParameterizedTest
                @ValueSource(strings = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
                void testWithStringValues(String fruit) {
                    assertTrue(fruit.length() > 0);
                }
            }
        ```

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   What is the use of @EnumSource in JUnit ?

>>  The @EnumSource annotation is used in parameterized tests to provide values from an enum type as test inputs.

    It is used to run the same test logic for each constant in an enum (or a filtered subset).

    Example:
        
        ```
            enum Direction {
                NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
            }
        ```

        ```
            @ParameterizedTest
            @EnumSource(Direction.class)
            void testAllDirections(Direction dir) {
                assertNotNull(dir);
            }
        ```

    Advanced Filtering:

        (1) Use names to include only specific enum constants:

            ```
                @ParameterizedTest
                @EnumSource(value = Direction.class, names = {"NORTH", "SOUTH"})
                void testWithSpecificDirections(Direction dir) {
                    assertTrue(dir == Direction.NORTH || dir == Direction.SOUTH);
                }
            ```

        (2) Use mode = EXCLUDE to exclude certain values:

            ```
                @ParameterizedTest
                @EnumSource(value = Direction.class, names = "EAST", mode = EnumSource.Mode.EXCLUDE)
                void testExcludingEast(Direction dir) {
                    assertNotEquals(Direction.EAST, dir);
                }
            ```

*   What is the use of @CsvSource in JUnit ?

>>  The @CsvSource annotation in JUnit 5 is used with parameterized tests to pass multiple sets of input values directly 
    from inline CSV data. 
    
    It allows you to test the same logic against different combinations of inputs and expected outputs.

    Example:

        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
            import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.CsvSource;
            import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

            public class StringUtilsTest {

                @ParameterizedTest
                @CsvSource({
                    "hello, HELLO",
                    "world, WORLD",
                    "'Abc', 'ABC'"
                })
                void testToUpper(String input, String expected) {
                    assertEquals(expected, input.toUpperCase());
                }
            }
        ```

*   What is the use of @ArgumentsSource in JUnit ?

>>  The @ArgumentsSource annotation allows you to supply complex or custom arguments to a parameterized test method by 
    referencing a custom ArgumentsProvider implementation.

    To support advanced or dynamic test data injection beyond what @ValueSource, @CsvSource, or @EnumSource can handle.

    Step-by-Step Usage:

        (1) Create a class that implements ArgumentsProvider:

            ```
                import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.Arguments;
                import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ArgumentsProvider;
                import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ArgumentsSource;
                import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
                import java.util.stream.Stream;

                public class MyArgumentsProvider implements ArgumentsProvider {

                    @Override
                    public Stream<? extends Arguments> provideArguments(org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtensionContext context) {
                        return Stream.of(
                            Arguments.of("java", 4),
                            Arguments.of("junit", 5),
                            Arguments.of("test", 4)
                        );
                    }
                }
            ```

        (2) Use it in a test:

            ```
                @ParameterizedTest
                @ArgumentsSource(MyArgumentsProvider.class)
                void testWithCustomProvider(String word, int expectedLength) {
                    assertEquals(expectedLength, word.length());
                }
            ```

*   How to integrate Junit in Spring Application ?

>>  Steps to integrate JUnit in a Spring Application:
        
        (1) Add Dependencies: 
        
            - Include the necessary dependencies for JUnit and Spring Test in your pom.xml.

            ```
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
                    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
                    <scope>test</scope>
                </dependency>
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
                    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-engine</artifactId>
                    <scope>test</scope>
                </dependency>
                
                <!-- Spring Test Context -->
                <dependency>
                    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
                    <artifactId>spring-test</artifactId>
                    <scope>test</scope>
                </dependency>
            ```

        (2) Create Test Class: 
        
            - In your test class, use annotations like @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class) to enable Spring support in JUnit 5.

        (3) Load Spring Context: 
        
            - Use the @SpringBootTest or @ContextConfiguration annotations to load the Spring application context for 
              integration tests.

        (4) Autowired Components: 
        
            - You can @Autowired Spring beans (e.g., services, repositories) into your test class to test them.

    Example:
        
        ```
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
            import org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith;
            import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
            import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
            import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

            @SpringBootTest
            @ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
            class CalculatorServiceTest {

                @Autowired
                private CalculatorService calculatorService;  // Injecting Spring bean

                @Test
                void testAddition() {
                    int result = calculatorService.add(2, 3);
                    assertEquals(5, result);
                }
            }
        ```
